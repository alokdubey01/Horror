                Smells of dirt and wet and long-gone vegetables would merge into
                one unmistakable ineluctable smell, the smell of the monster, the apotheosis of all monsters. It was the
                smell of something for which he had no name: the smell of It, crouched and lurking and ready to spring.
                A creature which would eat anything but which was especially hungry for boymeat.
